## Counter

## Project Description

Counter Component Implementation in Next.js

This section details the implementation of the counter component in your Next.js project, specifically focusing on the Counter.js file.

## Functionality

State Management: Utilizes the useState hook to manage the counter value, ensuring reactivity and hot reloading.
Increment: The + button increases the counter by 1 using the setCount function, triggered by an onClick event listener.
Decrement: The - button decreases the counter by 1, but prevents going below 0 by introducing a conditional count && check.
Concise Syntax: Employs the optional chaining operator (?.) for clarity in the decrement button handler.
Clarity: The code is well-formatted and includes inline comments to enhance readability.
